Hello! Good Afternoon team.
Congrats for the “Book Store” exercise. Nice to see how you are growing like future developers.
In this case I don't want to say you how to make nothing in the project. Let fly your imagination.
I show you a sneak peak of my possible solution. You need to make something like this, or something completely different. Play!!

Here is the data:

And here is the snapshot of my project:

P.D. - An interesting approach is to use a search input to find the city that you want. But you have to “play” with the open weather API.

Good luck guys.
